## Creating Icons

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tool.

Suggested icon design:
- Main color: Purple/Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Symbol: Form/document icon with a lock or shield
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Quick Placeholder

For testing purposes, you can use any square PNG images and name them accordingly.
The extension will still work without icons, but they won't display properly.
